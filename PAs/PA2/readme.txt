NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

NOTE: It is helpful if you write at most 80 characters per line,
and avoid including special characters, so we can read your responses.

Please summarize the help you found useful for this assignment, which
may include office hours, discussion with peers, tutors, et cetera.
Saying "a CP on Tuesday" is ok if you don't remember their name.
If none, say "none".

: discussion with peers, CP on Friday

================================ Questions ==================================

1. Did you use the 'suit', 'type' and 'value' arrays? What functions are easier
to implement when using these arrays? How do you use them?

: Yes I used the suit, type, and value arrays which made the functions printCard and getBestScore easier in particular. To use them, I would call a specific value within the array with different loops.

2. Did you add any additional functions to your implementation? If so briefly
describe how the functions improved your solution.

: I did not add any additional functions to my implementation. 

3. There are many ways to shuffle the deck of cards. The method used in our
implementation generates a permutaion of the cards to shuffle. For an array of
size N, how many swap (exchange) operations does this algorithm do? Does the
algorithm require any extra memory to generate a permutation?

: For an array of size N this algorithm does as many swaps as are seeded into it with the random number's seed value. The algorithm does not require ant extra memory to generate this permutation since it i simply randomizes the order of the initial array.
