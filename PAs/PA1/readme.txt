================================ Questions ==================================

1. I used a while loop because it could iterate through each of the input numbers while I could also take into account test cases and multiple if statements.
   
2. I used a for loop because it could go through the number of divisors up until it reached the number itself, which would not be counted when calculating abundance.
  
3. I could have used the idioms divisibility/factor, swap rotation, and moving window (shifting values) for helping determine the factors used to calculate abundance, moving around values of numbers with abundance, and dealing with rankings of abundance, respectively.
