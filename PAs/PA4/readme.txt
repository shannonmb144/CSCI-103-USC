If none, say "none".

: discussion with peers
=============================== Prelab ==================================

1. What data structure will you use to remember which cells have
already been added to the queue or not?

:  I'll use a 2D array that's been dynamically allocated.

2. At what step of the BFS algorithm do you have to mark a cell as visited?

: You have to mark the cell as visited before adding it to the queue.

=============================== Review ==================================

1. Describe your "mymaze.txt" test file. It should have multiple paths
of different distances. When you ran your program on it, did your program 
behave as expected?

: My mymaze.txt was a simple straight line from start to finsih with only one wall. 
It behaved as expected since I left it pretty simple.

============================== Remarks ==================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.
